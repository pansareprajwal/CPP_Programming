# C++ Programming

This repository contains my collection of C++ programs created while learning and practicing the fundamentals of C++ programming.  
It serves as a personal record of progress — from understanding the basics of syntax and object-oriented principles to solving logical and algorithmic problems.

---

## Overview
The purpose of this repository is to:
- Strengthen my understanding of **core C++ concepts**.  
- Develop **object-oriented programming** and **problem-solving skills**.  
- Maintain a **structured archive** of all practice programs and assignments.

Each program is written, compiled, and tested individually, focusing on readability, correctness, and adherence to standard C++ practices.

---

## Topics Covered
- Basic Input and Output (`cin`, `cout`)  
- Conditional Statements (`if`, `else`, `switch`)  
- Loops (`for`, `while`, `do-while`)  
- Functions and Recursion  
- Arrays and Strings  
- Pointers and References  
- Classes and Objects  
- Inheritance and Polymorphism  
- Exception Handling  
- File Handling *(upcoming)*  
- Standard Template Library (STL) *(upcoming)*

## How to Compile and Run

### On Windows / Linux / macOS
```bash

g++ Program.cpp -o Program
./Program

g++ folder/Program.cpp -o folder/Program
./folder/Program

```
